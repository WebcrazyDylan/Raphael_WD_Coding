                <h3>BUDGET / SUMMARY OF EXPENSES</h3>
                <strong>ACCOMMODATIONS</strong>  
                    <br/>Everyone has their preferences, but on our most recent trip, we stayed at a guesthouse in Hongdae for around KRW 60,000 per night. This is the room rate for two people for a room with a private bathroom. Expect to pay considerably less if you’re staying at a hostel.
                    <br/><br/><strong>MEALS</strong>
                    <br/>This is also subjective but based on our experience, I’d say around KRW 30,000 a day per person. Inexpensive but filling dishes like gomtang or seolnongtang typically cost between KRW 10,000-15,000. Add more to your budget if you plan on eating Korean BBQ.
                    <br/><br/><strong>POCKET WIFI RENTAL</strong>
                    <br/>If you’re sharing the cost with one other person, then you’ll each be paying around KRW 1,500 per day.
                    <br/><br/><strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong>
                    <br/>If you have a T-money card and use the subway, then you’ll be paying at least KRW 1,250 per journey. Assuming you’ll be taking around three subway journeys per day, expect to spend about KRW 4,000 a day for transportation.

            <p><h2>The First-Timer’s Travel Guide to Seoul, South Korea (2020)</h2>            
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearly everyone we know is obsessed with Seoul and South Korea. Some are into the cosmetics. Many are hooked on the music and television dramas. And almost everyone, including us, is in love with the food.
            </p>
            <p>       
                South Korean technology and pop culture has exploded into the global mainstream in recent years. This “Korean Wave” has turned Seoul into one of the hottest destinations in Asia, bringing in over 17.5 million international tourists in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the travel slowdown has brought this tourism wave to a halt, but expect it to surge with a vengeance when borders open up. Until then, you can plan your future trip with the latest edition of our Seoul travel guide.   
            </p>
            <p>Read about the best things to do, the coolest neighborhoods to visit, and the tastiest dishes to eat to get you even more excited about visiting the land of kimchee, K-pop, and Korean cosmetics!

            <p><h2>TRAVEL TIPS</h2>       
            <p><strong>1. Plan your Trip with Sygic Travel</strong><br/>
                Some people may find trip planning a little tedious or daunting. This free trip planning can make it easier and more fun.<br>
                What Sygic Travel does is allow you to visualize everything on a map, so you can easily group places of interest by location and put them all together in an efficient itinerary. Check out my article on the Sygic Travel app for more information.
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. Rent a Pocket Wifi Device</strong><br/>
                A constant wifi connection is a necessity these days, especially when you’re away on a trip. You’ll need it to translate, do research, use ride-sharing apps, and find your favorite K-drama filming locations. We never go anywhere now without renting a pocket wifi device first.<br>
                You can stay connected in Seoul by renting a pocket wifi device or buying a sim card. We always rent pocket wifi devices but sim cards are perfectly fine too. They’re even cheaper.<br>        
                Regardless of your preference, you can rent a pocket wifi device or buy a sim card through Klook. If you’re in Asia, then be sure to go through the list as it may be cheaper to pick it up from your origin country.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Get an Integrated Palace Ticket</strong><br/>
                If you want to visit as many palaces as you can in Seoul, then you should definitely get an integrated palace ticket. Entrance to four major palaces — Changdeokgung (including Huwon), Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung — plus Jongmyo Shrine will normally cost you a total of KRW 17,000 for adults. With the integrated palace ticket, you’ll have access to all five for just KRW 10,000.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. Check for Discount Passes</strong><br/>
                I love going through e-commerce sites to find travel deals. I’ve bought vouchers from several different websites but for Seoul, my favorites are Klook, Get Your Guide, and KKday. They have the widest selection at the best prices.<br>
                If you’re looking for deals on tours, shows, theme parks, and airport transfers in Seoul, then check out Klook, Get Your Guide, and KKday. Even if I don’t buy anything, I often find interesting activities that I may not think of myself so it’s always worth a look.
