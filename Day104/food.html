                <h3>BUDGET / SUMMARY OF EXPENSES</h3>
                <strong>ACCOMMODATIONS</strong>  
                    <br/>Everyone has their preferences, but on our most recent trip, we stayed at a guesthouse in Hongdae for around KRW 60,000 per night. This is the room rate for two people for a room with a private bathroom. Expect to pay considerably less if you’re staying at a hostel.
                    <br/><br/><strong>MEALS</strong>
                    <br/>This is also subjective but based on our experience, I’d say around KRW 30,000 a day per person. Inexpensive but filling dishes like gomtang or seolnongtang typically cost between KRW 10,000-15,000. Add more to your budget if you plan on eating Korean BBQ.
                    <br/><br/><strong>POCKET WIFI RENTAL</strong>
                    <br/>If you’re sharing the cost with one other person, then you’ll each be paying around KRW 1,500 per day.
                    <br/><br/><strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong>
                    <br/>If you have a T-money card and use the subway, then you’ll be paying at least KRW 1,250 per journey. Assuming you’ll be taking around three subway journeys per day, expect to spend about KRW 4,000 a day for transportation.

            <p><h2>WHERE TO EAT IN SEOUL</h2>       
            <p><strong>1. Yeontabal BBQ Restaurant</strong><br/>
                Gogigui or Korean BBQ is one of our favorite things about Korean food. Marinated meats like bulgogi and galbi barbecued over a charcoal grill are absolutely delicious.<br>
                These grilled king beef ribs at Yeontabal were some of the best we’ve ever had. Smokey, savory-sweet, and super tender, they were to die for, especially when eaten with steamed white rice and kimchi.<br>
                Keep in mind that meat is typically expensive in Korea, so expect Korean BBQ to be one of your more expensive meals. You can get a small discount at Yeontabal if you purchase a voucher through Klook.

            </p>
            <p><strong>2. Woo Lae Oak</strong><br/>
                I’ve been wanting to try naengmyeon (buckwheat noodles served in cold broth) ever since I saw a documentary about North Korea. It’s originally a North Korean delicacy that became popular throughout the peninsula after the Korean War.<br>
                I searched for the best places to try naengmyeon and Woo Lae Oak, one of Seoul’s oldest restaurants, often came up. They’re a Korean BBQ restaurant that’s equally famous for their naengmyeon.

            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Myeongdong Kyoja</strong><br/>
                Myeongdong Kyoja is widely regarded as having the best kalguksu in the city. Kalguksu is a noodle dish consisting of handmade, knife-cut wheat flour noodles served in a large bowl with broth and other ingredients.<br>
                Myeongdong Kyoja has been in business for over 50 years and is located in the heart of Myeongdong. It’s a great place to have lunch or dinner when shopping in the area.
